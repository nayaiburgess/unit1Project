First I would like to thank Noah, for his constructive criticism and motivation. Noah has pushed me to not just take the easy way out when I come across a problem.

I also would like to thank the hangman group! Everyone has been so helpful and encouraging. Super shout out to Daniel and Stanley for getting me through my two biggest blockers. Justin also coached me in the end for my minor changes.
