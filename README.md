First I would like to thank Noah, for his constructive criticism and motivation. Noah has pushed me to not just take the easy way out when I come across a problem.

I also would like to thank the hangman group! Everyone has been so helpful and encouraging. Super shout out to Daniel and Stanley for getting me through my two biggest blockers. Justin also coached me in the end for my minor changes.

I chose to create HANGMAN for project 1. The ultimate goal of the game was for the user to be able to guess the letters of a hidden word in no specific order. If the user guesses an incorrect letter a body part of a stick figure will appear. You only have six incorrect attempts. If the user guesses the right word, the letter then appears in its correct spot of the word.
